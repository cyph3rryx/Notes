## Static Analysis Techniques
- Learn techniques for analyzing malware without executing it, including antivirus scanning, malware hashing, and string analysis.
- Explore methods for detecting malware packers and obfuscation.
- Inspect the Portable Executable (PE) header and explore Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

## Assembly Crash Course
- Gain a fundamental understanding of X86 assembly language, including the architecture, memory, registers, and assembly instructions.

## Behavior Analysis
- Dive into dynamic analysis and sandboxing techniques.
- Explore dynamic analysis tools and learn how to run malware for analysis.
- Perform runtime analysis using tools like Process Monitor, Process Explorer, Snapshot, and network monitoring tools.

## Debugging and Disassembly Techniques
- Discover debugging and disassembly techniques for analyzing malicious code.
- Understand Windows API, file system functions, Windows registry, DLLs, and exceptions.

## Obfuscation Techniques
- Explore various obfuscation techniques used by malware authors.

## Basic Static Analysis
- Delve deeper into basic static analysis, focusing on antivirus scanning, malware hashing, malware strings, and packer/obfuscation detection.
- Inspect the Portable Executable (PE) header and explore Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

## Basic Dynamic Analysis
- Learn dynamic analysis techniques, including sandboxing and the use of dynamic analysis tools.
- Analyze malware behavior at runtime and monitor network activity.

## Core X86 Assembly Concepts
- Deepen your knowledge of X86 assembly concepts, including the architecture, memory, registers, and stack.
- Get hands-on experience with assembly instruction.

## Reverse Engineering Code Analysis with IDA Pro
- Understand how to use IDA Pro for reverse engineering code analysis.
- Analyze malicious code and learn about Windows API, file system functions, Windows registry, and DLLs.

## Malware Behavior
- Explore different aspects of malware behavior, including functionality, command and control, custom C2 samples, and persistence mechanisms.
- Understand how attackers use PowerShell for their malicious activities.

## Self Defending Malware
- Learn about packer and unpacking techniques, including identification methods and unpacking complexities.
- Explore structured exception handlers, bypassing analysis defenses, and various malware defensive techniques like anti-disassembly, anti-debugging, and anti-virtual machine measures.
