## Keccak256

We want our `_generateRandomDna` function to return a (semi) random `uint`. How can we accomplish this?

Ethereum has the hash function `keccak256` built in, which is a version of SHA3. A hash function basically maps an input into a random 256-bit hexadecimal number. A slight change in the input will cause a large change in the hash.

It's useful for many purposes in Ethereum, but for right now we're just going to use it for pseudo-random number generation.

Also important, `keccak256` expects a single parameter of type `bytes`. This means that we have to "pack" any parameters before calling `keccak256`:

Example:

```solidity
//6e91ec6b618bb462a4a6ee5aa2cb0e9cf30f7a052bb467b0ba58b8748c00d2e5
keccak256(abi.encodePacked("aaaab"));
//b1f078126895a1424524de5321b339ab00408010b7cf0e6ed451514981e58aa9
keccak256(abi.encodePacked("aaaac"));
```

As you can see, the returned values are totally different despite only a 1 character change in the input.
